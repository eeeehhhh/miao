<h3>The Road to Eeslightenment</h3>
<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browers-specific tags,incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s,broken <abbr title="Cassading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>support, and abandoned browers.</p>

<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
  <h3>Requirement</h3>
  <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets,levels 1 and 2"> CSS1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage.<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provied. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>and not the latest bleeding-edge triks viewable by 2% of the browing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS<abbr>validates.</p>
  <p>Luckily,designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS
  </abbr>by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agent on the web these days - especially when you factor in mobile - pixel-perfect layouts may not be possbile across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chorme, Firefox,ios and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
  <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. please respect copyright laws. Please keep
    objectionable material to a minmum, and try to incorporate unique an interesting visual themes to your work. We're well past the point of needing another garden-related desgin.</p>
